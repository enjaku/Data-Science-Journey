### Week 1

These are notes of the first week of Inferential Statistics.  I'm utting them in a markdown document and loading up to GitHub as an experient in workflow.

Let the fun begin.

- Samply Variability - estimates how one sample varies from another
- Samplying Distribution
    + Take sample statistics, e.g. mean, mode, etc., from several different samples from the population and then look at them as a group... finding the **SampLING Distribution**. 
    + Standard Deviation of the Sample Means (SampLING Distribution) is called the **Standard Error$**.
    + As n increses the Standard Error will decrease.
