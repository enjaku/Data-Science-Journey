#SQL For Data Science#
##Week 1##

SQL is a non-procedual language where you cannot write complete applcations with it.

- Read
- Retrieve
- Write
- Update and Insert New Data

"Think before you Do".  Plan first, understand waht it is that you want to do and how the data relates to one another.   

Columns and **Records** (rows) 

**Data modelling** is what we use to organize information for multiple tables and how they relate to each other together.
    - Should always represent a real-world problem.

_Relational Model_  
    - Unstructured data (XML).  XML Data Enchanges
    - RDBMS
    - Scale up: need to add components to the box
    - Normalization: allows the data to stay in one place
    - SQL
    - Can create constraints
    -  ACID complient

_NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Model_   
    -  Big data    
    -  NoSQL is really a mechanism for storage and retrieval where it's not modeled in a tabular relational format
    -  MongoDB ??
    -  No redefined schema (very flexible)
    -  Handles unstructured data  
    -  Scaling out (aka Horizontal scaling):
    -  Non-Relational DB (no tables)
    -  Add additional nodes or clusters...far cheaper than hanging more stuff on a single box    
    -  
**Types of No SQL DBs**    
    - Doncument (MongoDB, CouchDB)
    - Column DBs (Apache Casandra)
    - Key_Value_Stores (Redis, Couchbase Server)
    - Cache Systems (Redis, Memcache)
    - Graph Databaes (Neo4J)
