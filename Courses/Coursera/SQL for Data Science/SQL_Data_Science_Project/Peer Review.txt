Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table =10000        
ii. Business table = 10000     
iii. Category table =10000     
iv. Checkin table =10000     
v. elite_years table =10000     
vi. friend table =10000      
vii. hours table =10000      
viii. photo table = 10000      
ix. review table =10000       
x. tip table =10000      
xi. user table =10000    
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 		100000	(id)     
ii. Hours =  		1562	(business_id)     
iii. Category =  	2643	(business_id)           
iv. Attribute = 	1115	(business_id)   
v. Review=			10000	(id)  			8090 (business_id)	9581 (user_id)
vi. Checkin = 		493		(business_id)     
vii. Photo = 		10000	(id)			6493 (busness_id)    
viii. Tip = 		3979	(business_id)	537 (user_id)			  
ix. User = 			10000    (id) 
x. Friend = 		11		(user_id)     
xi. Elite_years = 	2780	(user_id)      

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	**Answer:** No.
	
	
	**SQL code used to arrive at answer:**
	SELECT id, name, review_count, yelping_since, useful, funny, cool, fans, average_stars, compliment_hot, compliment_more, compliment_profile, compliment_cute, compliment_list, compliment_note, compliment_plain, compliment_cool, compliment_funny, compliment_writer, compliment_photos
		FROM  user
		WHERE 	id is null
				OR name is null
				OR review_count is null
				OR yelping_since is null
				OR useful is null
				OR funny is null
				OR cool is null
				OR fans is null
				OR average_stars is null
				OR compliment_hot is null
				OR compliment_more is null
				OR compliment_profile is null
				OR compliment_cute is null
				OR compliment_list is null
				OR compliment_note is null
				OR compliment_plain is null
			  	OR compliment_cool is null
				OR compliment_funny is null
				OR compliment_writer is null
				OR compliment_photos is null
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:		max:		avg:
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:		max:		avg:
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:		max:		avg:
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:		max:		avg:
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min:		max:		avg:
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
         
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
